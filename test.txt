          "To explore the perceptions of parents regarding the preparation of their children for surgery.",
          "A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. Sixteen parents of children who were undergoing various types of elective surgery in a public tertiary hospital in Singapore were recruited. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis.",
          "Five themes were derived: (1) assumed roles of the parents; (2) communication, decision-making, and emotional challenges; (3) factors facilitating the preparation of children for surgery; (4) surgery-related and financial concerns; and (5) the desire for more information and better management. While preparing their children for surgery, parents undertook several roles to ensure readiness and to provide support. Parents faced challenges while communicating with their children regarding their surgeries, experiencing negative emotions and dilemmas in making decisions for surgery. Factors such as previous experiences, children's positive mentality, and access to information helped to facilitate their preparation. Parents expressed surgery-related concerns such as anesthesia and a successful outcome of the surgery, the timing of the surgery, and postoperative care. Parents expressed a desire for easier to understand information through the use of visual materials, and improvements in current practices and management.",
          "This study provides a greater understanding of parents' perceptions of their roles, challenges, influencing factors, concerns, and needs when preparing their children for surgery.",
          "The study findings provide insightful aspects for improving current healthcare practices and informing future research studies in exploring better surgery preparation programs for both parents and children."

          "This data describes the modern surgical treatment of congenital vallecular cyst in a term newborn infant who developed neonatal stridor on day 1 of life. Diagnosis was made by nasoendoscopy and the infant underwent successful treatment by marsupialization via coblation technique. Images and videos were taken during the procedure both pre and post-operatively. This case highlights the need for an interdisciplinary evaluation of persistent neonatal stridor in newborn infants for early diagnosis and intervention to avoid critical airway obstruction and potentially fatal outcomes, DOI: 10.1016/j.epsc.2020.101460[1]."

          "Oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (OBCS) can cause breast asymmetry. Although contralateral breast surgery to achieve symmetry was offered to these patients, the uptake of symmetrisation was variable. We aimed to determine the factors that deter patients with breast cancer undergoing OBCS from taking up symmetrisation.",
          "All patients with breast cancer who underwent OBCS of displacement type but no symmetrisation were prospectively surveyed to explore social, economic, psychological and physical reasons against symmetrisation.",
          "28 patients participated in a survey administered at a mean 21.6 (range 2-47) months after OBCS. A combination of factors, such as worry and desire to treat breast cancer first (67.9%), not being overly concerned about breast cosmesis (57.1%) and fear of pain from additional operation (28.6%) deterred patients from immediate symmetrisation. Worry and desire to treat breast cancer first was the most important single factor for 50% of patients. Reasons for no delayed symmetrisation included not being overly concerned about breast cosmesis (70.4%), fear of breast cancer recurrence (48.1%) and being happy with current breast cosmesis (33.3%), with the former two reasons equally cited as the single most important deterrent by 30% of patients each.",
          "A combination of factors may deter patients from symmetrisation. The most significant factors deterring OBCS among patients were worry and desire to treat breast cancer first for immediate symmetrisation, and not being overly concerned about breast cosmesis and fear of breast cancer recurrence for delayed symmetrisation. Reassurance of these patients may increase their uptake of symmetrisation, thereby improving patient cosmesis and satisfaction."

          "This study aimed to investigate the trend and seasonality of infection due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) in Singapore and to examine the risk factors for mortality among children with RSV infection requiring admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU).",
          "A retrospective study was conducted at KKH on children with RSV infections who were admitted to the PICU between January 2004 and December 2010. The medical records of children who died from RSV infections were reviewed. Linear regression was performed to determine the risk factors of RSV mortality.",
          "RSV infection was documented in 5,785 children during the study period, occurring throughout the year, with a small increase in prevalence between the months of June and August annually. Among 85 (1.5%) of 5,785 children who were admitted to the PICU for RSV infection, 74 (1.3%) survived and there were 11 (0.2%) deaths. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that significant haemodynamically significant cardiac disease (odds ratio [OR] 12.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-16.7, p = 0.05), immunodeficiency (OR 71.4, 95% CI 8.2-500, p < 0.001) and metabolic disease (OR 71.4, 95% CI 4.3-1,000, p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for mortality in RSV infections. Prematurity increased the risk of admission to the PICU but was not significantly associated with mortality.",
          "Children with haemodynamically significant cardiac disease, immunodeficiency and metabolic disease were at higher risk of death after hospitalisation for RSV-related illnesses. These children should be considered for palivizumab prophylaxis."

          "The human gut microbiota develops soon after birth and can acquire inter-individual variation upon exposure to intrinsic and environmental cues. However, inter-individual variation has not been comprehensively assessed in a multi-ethnic study. We studied a longitudinal birth cohort of 106 infants of three Asian ethnicities (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) that resided in the same geographical location (Singapore). Specific and temporal influences of ethnicity, mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, gestational age, birthweight, gender, and maternal education on the development of the gut microbiota in the first 2 years of life were studied. Mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, and ethnicity were identified as the main factors influencing the compositional development of the gut microbiota. Effects of delivery mode and breastfeeding status lasted until 6M and 3M, respectively, with the primary impact on the diversity and temporal colonization of the genera <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. The effect of ethnicity was apparent at 3M post-birth, even before the introduction of weaning (complementary) foods, and remained significant after adjusting for delivery mode and breastfeeding status. Ethnic influences remained significant until 12M in the Indian and Chinese infants. The microbiota of Indian infants was characterized by higher abundances of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, while Chinese infants had higher abundances of <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>. These findings provide a detailed insight into the specific and temporal influences of early life factors and ethnicity in the development of the human gut microbiota.

          "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are toxic to mammalian cells. However, during meiosis, more than 200 DSBs are generated deliberately, to ensure reciprocal recombination and orderly segregation of homologous chromosomes. If left unrepaired, meiotic DSBs can cause aneuploidy in gametes and compromise viability in offspring. Oocytes in which DSBs persist are therefore eliminated by the DNA-damage checkpoint. Here we show that the DNA-damage checkpoint eliminates oocytes via the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 pathway members Puma, Noxa and Bax. Deletion of these factors prevents oocyte elimination in recombination-repair mutants, even when the abundance of unresolved DSBs is high. Remarkably, surviving oocytes can extrude a polar body and be fertilised, despite chaotic chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division. Our findings raise the possibility that allelic variants of the BCL-2 pathway could influence the risk of embryonic aneuploidy."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Current literature on the roles of \u03b1-, \u03b2-carotene and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin in neurocognitive function has largely focused on preventing cognitive decline in older people, and less on neuro-development in children. We examined the relations of maternal plasma carotenoids concentrations with offspring cognitive development up to age 4.5\u00a0years in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes mother-offspring cohort study.",
          "Maternal plasma \u03b1-, \u03b2-carotene and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin concentrations at delivery were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Children's cognition was assessed at ages 2 (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development) and 4.5 (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test) years. Associations were examined in 419 mother-offspring pairs using linear regressions adjusting for key confounders.",
          "Median and interquartile range of maternal plasma concentrations (mg/L) were: \u03b1-carotene 0.052 (0.032, 0.081), \u03b2-carotene 0.189 (0.134, 0.286), and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin 0.199 (0.123, 0.304). In 2\u00a0years old children, higher maternal carotenoids [per standard deviation (SD) log-concentration] were positively associated with neurocognitive functions: \u03b2-cryptoxanthin with higher scores in cognitive [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.18, (0.08, 0.28) SD], receptive language [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17 (0.07, 0.27) SD], fine motor [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.16 (0.05, 0.26) SD], and gross motor [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.16 (0.06, 0.27) SD] scales; \u03b2-carotene with higher cognitive score [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17 (0.05, 0.29) SD]. No significant associations were observed with neurocognitive functions at age 4.5\u00a0years.",
          "Our study provides novel data suggesting a potential role of prenatal carotenoids, particularly \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, on early offspring cognitive and motor development. Whether the prenatal influences sustain beyond early childhood requires further investigation in longer term studies."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Maternal glycaemia promotes fetal adiposity. Inositol, an insulin sensitizer, has been trialled for gestational diabetes prevention. The placenta has been implicated in how maternal hyperglycaemia generates fetal pathophysiology, but no studies have examined whether placental inositol biology is altered with maternal hyperglycaemia, nor whether such alterations impact fetal physiology. We aimed to investigate whether the effects of maternal glycaemia on offspring birthweight and adiposity at birth differed across placental inositol levels.",
          "Using longitudinal data from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes cohort, maternal fasting glucose (FPG) and 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) were obtained in pregnant women by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test around 26 weeks' gestation. Relative placental inositol was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Primary outcomes were birthweight (n\u2009=\u2009884) and abdominal adipose tissue (AAT) volumes measured by neonatal MRI scanning in a subset (n\u2009=\u2009262) of term singleton pregnancies. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed.",
          "Placental inositol was lower in those with higher 2hPG, no exposure to tobacco smoke antenatally, with vaginal delivery and shorter gestation. Positive associations of FPG with birthweight (adjusted \u03b2 [95% CI] 164.8\u2009g [109.1, 220.5]) and AAT (17.3\u2009ml [11.9, 22.6] per mmol glucose) were observed, with significant interactions between inositol tertiles and FPG in relation to these outcomes (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Stratification by inositol tertiles showed that each mmol/L increase in FPG was associated with increased birthweight and AAT volume among cases within the lowest (birthweight\u2009=\u2009174.2\u2009g [81.2, 267.2], AAT\u2009=\u200921.0\u2009ml [13.1, 28.8]) and middle inositol tertiles (birthweight\u2009=\u2009202.0\u2009g [103.8, 300.1], AAT\u2009=\u200919.7\u2009ml [9.7, 29.7]). However, no significant association was found among cases within the highest tertile (birthweight\u2009=\u200981.0\u2009g [-21.2, 183.2], AAT\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009ml [-8.4, 10.0]).",
          "High placental inositol may protect the fetus from the pro-adipogenic effects of maternal glycaemia. Studies are warranted to investigate whether prenatal inositol supplementation can increase placental inositol and reduce fetal adiposity."

          "Endometriosis is a common inflammatory gynecological disorder which causes pelvic scarring, pain, and infertility, characterized by the implantation of endometrial-like lesions outside the uterus. The peritoneum, ovaries, and deep soft tissues are the commonly involved sites, and endometriotic lesions can be classified into three subphenotypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis (PE), ovarian endometrioma (OE), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). In 132 women diagnosed laparoscopically with and without endometriosis (<i>n</i> = 73, 59 respectively), and stratified into PE, OE, and DIE, peritoneal fluids (PF) were characterized for 48 cytokines by using multiplex immunoassays. Partial-least-squares-regression analysis revealed distinct subphenotype cytokine signatures-a six-cytokine signature distinguishing PE from OE, a seven-cytokine signature distinguishing OE from DIE, and a six-cytokine-signature distinguishing PE from DIE-each associated with different patterns of biological processes, signaling events, and immunology. These signatures describe endometriosis better than disease stages (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Pathway analysis revealed the association of ERK1 and 2, AKT, MAPK, and STAT4 linked to angiogenesis, cell proliferation, migration, and inflammation in the subphenotypes. These data shed new insights on the pathophysiology of endometriosis subphenotypes, with the potential to exploit the cytokine signatures to stratify endometriosis patients for targeted therapies and biomarker discovery."

          "Emergency airway management of critically ill children in the Emergency Department (ED) is associated with the risk of intubation-related desaturation, which can be minimized by apneic oxygenation. We evaluated the use of apneic oxygenation in the pediatric ED and reported a quality improvement initiative to incorporate apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during rapid sequence intubations (RSIs).",
          "A baseline period from June 2016 to April 2017 highlighted the practice gaps. Quality improvement interventions were subsequently developed and implemented as a care bundle consisting of a pre-intubation checklist, placing reminders and additional oxygen source in resuscitation bays, incorporating into the responsibilities of the airway doctor and the airway nurse (copiloting), education during airway workshops and simulation training for doctors and nurses, as well as enhancing documentation of the intubation process. We monitored a post-intervention observation period from May 2017 to April 2018 for the effectiveness of the care bundle.",
          "Apneic oxygenation was not performed in all 22 RSIs during the baseline period. Among 25 RSIs in the post-intervention observation period, providers performed apneic oxygenation in 17 (68%) cases. There was no significant difference in the utilization of apneic oxygenation among emergency physicians and pediatric anesthetists performing RSIs in the pediatric ED.",
          "We successfully implemented a care bundle targeted at incorporating apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during emergency intubations performed in ED. This method could be adopted by other pediatric EDs to improve airway management in critically ill children."

          "Patients with JIA were recruited from our Singapore pediatric rheumatology registry from January 1997 to December 2015. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcome data were retrospectively collected. Nonparametric statistics were used to describe the data. Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U, or Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to compare differences between groups where appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors for clinical parameters.",
          "Two hundred eighty-seven JIA patients with 60.6% males of predominantly Chinese descent were included in the study. The median onset age was 9\u00a0years (IQR 5.3-12.6), and the median follow-up duration was 30.1\u00a0months (IQR 9.1-61.7). Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA, 32.8%) followed by persistent oligoarthritis (31.0%) was the most common. Elbow or ankle involvement predicted oligoarthritis extension (OR 15.8 (95% CI: 2.3-108.3, p\u2009=\u20090.005), 8.1 (95% CI: 1.5-45.3, p\u2009=\u20090.017)). JIA-associated uveitis was rare (2.8%) which paralleled the less common positive-ANA rate. Majority of our ERA patients had HLA-B27 (79.8%), together with older age predicted sacroiliitis (OR 4.7 (95% CI: 2.0-11.1, p\u2009<\u20090.05), OR 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1-1.3, p\u2009=\u20090.002)). TMJ involvement was under-reported. Methotrexate remained the most common DMARD used, but 36% of patients required biologics for which ERA and polyarthritis were the majority. Joint damage was rare.",
          "This study highlights geographical and ethnic differences in JIA epidemiology. Compared with reports elsewhere, our JIA population had many unique findings and good functional outcomes requiring regional study validation.Key points\u2022 ERA is the most prominent JIA subtype in Singapore with high prevalence of HLA-B27.\u2022 JIA-associated uveitis is rare in SEA and is not associated with ANA or JIA-subtypes.\u2022 Elbow and/or ankle involvement at presentation is associated with oligoarthritis extension in our JIA cohort."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem disorder caused by germline heterozygous NF1 loss-of-function variants. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein, which functions by down-regulating RAS/RAF/MAPK-signalling pathways. Somatic NF1 aberrations frequently occur in sporadic ovarian cancer (OC), but the incidence of OC in NF1 patients is rare. Here we report the germline and somatic findings for two unrelated patients with NF1 and high-grade serous OC. Germline testing revealed a heterozygous NF1 pathogenic variant in each patient, c.7096_7101del (p.Asn2366_Phe2367del) and c.964delA (p.Ile322Leufs*54), respectively. No germline variants in well-established OC predisposition genes were detected, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. Tumor loss-of-heterozygosity analysis demonstrated loss of the wild type NF1 allele for both patients. Biallelic NF1 inactivation occurs as part of OC pathogenesis in NF1 patients. Although the penetrance of NF1-associated OC is insufficient to warrant risk-reducing interventions, our findings highlight the potential for therapies targeting the RAS/RAF/MAPK-signalling pathway for these cases."

          "An increase in human adenovirus (HAdV) infections among hospitalized children in Singapore was observed since 2013. Young age (<2 years) and significant comorbidities have been associated with severe HAdV infections which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Cidofovir (CDV) has been used to treat severe HAdV infections despite limited data and efficacy.",
          "This is a retrospective, observational review of infants and children 1 month to 17 years of age with laboratory-confirmed severe HAdV infection, admitted to a pediatric tertiary care hospital in Singapore between January 2013 and September 2017. Severe infection was defined as requiring intensive care unit or high dependency care at any point during hospital admission. Clinical characteristics, potential risk factors for mortality, as well as the outcome of cases treated with CDV were examined.",
          "A total of 1167 children were admitted for HAdV infection, of which 85 (7.3%) were severe. For severe infections, the median age was 1.5 years (interquartile range: 0.72-3.2 years). The majority had comorbidities (69.4%) and presented with pneumonia (32.9%). Genotypes HAdV-7 (29.4%) and HAdV-3 (27.0%) were the most common HAdV genotypes identified. Thirteen (15.3%) patients died. Patients who died had a higher proportion of existing neurologic comorbidity (46.2% vs. 13.9%; P = 0.014) and presentation with pneumonia (69.2% vs. 26.4%; P = 0.008) compared with survivors. Patients who presented with pneumonia had a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-28.6; P < 0.05). CDV was administered to 17 (20%) children for mainly viremia (47.1%) and/or pneumonia (41.2%). Mortality rate was 41.2% for severe HAdV cases treated with CDV. A significant proportion of patients who died when compared with recovered patients presented with pneumonia (6 of 7, 85.7% vs 1 of 10, 10%; P = 0.004). All 8 patients who had viremia received CDV and survived.",
          "Mortality can be high in pediatric patients with severe HAdV infections. HAdV-7 and HAdV-3 were the most common genotypes identified in our cohort with severe HAdV infection. Pneumonia is a potential risk factor for mortality in severe HAdV infections in our cohort. Early CDV administration may be considered in patients with severe HAdV infection and existing comorbidities but more studies are required."

          "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit gene (SCN9A) have been associated with pain in various settings. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the SNPs to evaluate the influence of common gene variants on chronic postoperative pain (CPSP) and other related pain variables in a cohort of patients who underwent a scheduled hysterectomy.",
          "DNA samples from a cohort of 1,075 patients who underwent a scheduled total hysterectomy in our hospital were genotyped for three common SCN9A SNPs using TaqMan assays. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between independent covariates such as pain threshold, pain endurance, pain scores, morphine use, and the presence of chronic pain.",
          "Frequencies of the minor alleles were different between the different ethnic groups. There was a statistically significant association of rs16851799 with morphine consumption and self-reported postoperative pain for the 1,038 subjects genotyped, with the TT genotype reporting higher pain and using more morphine. For the subpopulation of 446 subjects with chronic pain data, there was a similar association with self-reported postoperative pain and tolerance of pressure pain. Univariate analysis also showed a statistically significant association of rs16851799 with CPSP, whereas multivariable analysis revealed a similar association of rs4387806 with this outcome. There were three haplotypes with different relative frequencies for the CPSP and non-CPSP groups.",
          "Our results showed that SCN9A polymorphisms could play a role in acute pain perception and the susceptibility to chronic pain."

          "This study aims to examine the relationships among sociodemographic and obstetric factors, fear of childbirth, psychosocial well-being and childbirth self-efficacy using a structural equation modelling approach.",
          "It adopted an exploratory cross-sectional study among 205 multi-ethnic pregnant women in Singapore. We used structural equation modelling to examine our hypothetical model, which integrates the concepts of Bandura's self-efficacy theory and previous literature reviews. The Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory, the Childbirth Attitudes Questionnaire and the World Health Organisation (Five) Well-Being Index were employed to measure childbirth self-efficacy, fear of childbirth and psychological well-being, respectively.",
          "The structural equation model showed that multiparous women (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00. 24, P < 0.01), with better psychological well-being (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.26, P < 0.001) were more likely to have higher childbirth self-efficacy; whereas Chinese women (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.32, P < 0.01) with previous caesarean section (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.17, P < 0.05) and higher fear of childbirth (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.30, P < 0.001) were more likely to have lower childbirth self-efficacy. The structural equation model had good fit with the data (incremental fit index\u00a0=\u00a00.925, Tucker-Lewis index\u00a0=\u00a00.911, comparative fit index\u00a0=\u00a00.923, and root means square error of approximation\u00a0=\u00a00.048).",
          "Findings of this study highlight that ethnic Chinese, multiparous women, previous caesarean section, psychological well-being and fear of childbirth were determinants of childbirth self-efficacy among pregnant women in Singapore. Enhancement of self-efficacy can increase coping ability and reduce fear of childbirth and thus promote normal childbirth. Future self-efficacy enhancing interventions among pregnant women should be tailored by age, ethnicity, parity and prior modes of birth."

          "The provision of safe obstetric anaesthesia services is essential during the COVID-19 global outbreak. The identification of the 'high-infection risk' parturient can be challenging especially with the rapidly changing risk criteria for COVID-19 'cases'. A multidisciplinary taskforce is required to review the infection control protocols and workflows for managing the parturient for labour analgesia and for Caesarean section in order to minimize infection risk to healthcare staff and other parturients. A constant review of such processes is needed to enhance efficiency and to optimise use of finite resources. Good communication between health officials, institutional leadership and ground staff is essential for the dissemination of information."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Our public pediatric tertiary hospital in Singapore has been a part of a robust public health response to coronavirus 19 that has been calibrated in a timely manner to the evolving international situation. As of mid-March, Singapore remains in a containment mode with enhanced surveillance and limited community spread. Within this context, our service for pediatric eating disorder care has had to make significant adaptations to our models of service delivery as well as respond to the changing psychosocial needs of our patients. Given infection control requirements, we have instituted modular staffing for our inpatient and outpatient settings, necessitating task shifting and an increased use of technology for communication. Because of the reduced outpatient capacity and the need to minimize nonurgent trips to the hospital, we have implemented telemedicine and have leveraged on partnerships with school counselors and other community partners. \"Coronaphobia\" has influenced our patients' willingness to attend visits and worsened existing health anxiety for some. Responsiveness to families' and patients' health and financial concerns has been essential. As coronavirus 19 impacts more countries, our institution's experience can provide insight into challenges and possible adaptations to providing ongoing care for eating disorder patients in this environment."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Moisturizers are one of the mainstays of the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). One of the adverse effects of moisturizers is skin irritation, especially on excoriated AD skin. We compared the potential for irritation of two commercially available moisturizer products for the treatment of AD: a ceramide-based moisturizer (Ceradan<sup>\u00ae</sup> Cream; Hyphens Pharma Pte Ltd, Singapore) and a urea 5% moisturizer (Aqurea Lite Cream; ICA Pharma Pte Ltd, Singapore).",
          "We performed a prospective single-blind randomized controlled study recruiting AD patients aged between 8 and 16\u00a0years with symmetrical or near symmetrical scratch marks (excoriations) of at least grade 2 to 3 severity score, according to the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), over bilateral antecubital fossae. Subjects were randomized to receive the ceramide-based moisturizer to either the left or right antecubital fossa or urea 5% cream to the other antecubital fossa. Subjects were asked to grade the immediate skin irritation of both creams on a standard visual analogue scale (VAS) and which cream they would prefer to use as a daily moisturizer. Primary outcome was the mean irritant score of each cream, and secondary outcome was the subjects' preference of either cream as their daily moisturizer.",
          "A total of 42 participants were enrolled with a mean age of 11\u00a0years 5\u00a0months. The ceramide-based cream had a significantly lower mean VAS score (mean 0.69, SD\u2009=\u20091.63) for irritation compared with urea 5% cream (1.43, SD\u2009=\u20091.64) (p\u2009=\u20090.035). More participants also preferred the ceramide-based cream over urea 5% cream (62% versus 38%) as their daily moisturizer, but this did not reach statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.164).",
          "A ceramide-based moisturizer may be considered as a suitable choice for children to minimize irritation from moisturizer treatment for AD."

          "This case reports on a patient presenting with abdominal pain of 1-month duration; in whom, ultrasound (US) detected a colonic lipoma with intussusception. Further investigation with computed tomography confirmed this finding, and successful endoscopic removal of the lipoma was performed. This case highlights the importance of careful evaluation of the region of interest during US, knowing the appearance of lipoma on US and other modalities, thus aiding its adequate management."

          "Pediatric trauma patients presenting to general emergency departments (EDs) may be transferred to pediatric EDs for further management. Unnecessary transfers increase health-care costs, add to workload, and decrease satisfaction. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the proportion of unnecessary pediatric trauma transfers and describe patient characteristics of these transfers at the pediatric ED.",
          "A retrospective chart review of cases with trauma-related diagnoses was carried out from January to April 2017. Information regarding patient demographics, diagnosis, and clinical progress was collected. A transfer was defined as unnecessary if the patient was discharged from the pediatric ED without any therapeutic procedure performed.",
          "There were 117 cases of trauma transfers. The mean age was 8.3 \u00b1 4.9 years, and 77 (65.8%) patients were male. Ninety-five (81.2%) transfers were from restructured hospitals. Thirty-one (26.5%) cases were admitted to the hospital. Thirty-four (29.1%) cases were unnecessary transfers. The length of stay in the ED for these transferred cases was 118.4 \u00b1 87.1 min. Referring ED was not significantly associated with discharge (odds ratio [OR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-3.83, <i>P</i> = 0.792), discharge without any therapeutic procedure performed (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.50-4.31, <i>P</i> = 0.591), or length of stay (mean difference: 22.3 min, 95% CI: 84.5-39.9, <i>P</i> = 0.471).",
          "About a third of trauma transfers were unnecessary. Further collaborative efforts would be necessary to further define the situation in different health-care settings and exact reasons elucidated so that targeted interventions could be implemented to improve pediatric trauma care."

          "Children present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with enlarged lymph nodes due to a broad spectrum of conditions ranging from benign causes like reactive lymph nodes to adverse conditions like malignancy. Identifying sonographic features typical of infection, inflammation, and neoplasms will help assist clinicians in deciding the disposition of the patients from the ED. Point-of-care ultrasound has become an essential adjunct for diagnostic assessment in pediatric emergency medicine. The wider accessibility of ultrasound along with greater resolution using high-frequency probes places this noninvasive, nonradiation-based bedside examination, an ideal tool for real-time examination of the lymph nodes in the EDs.",
          "We present a series of cases in which the point-of-care ultrasound examination proved valuable in the timely diagnosis and expedited care of lymph node pathologies secondary to reactive, infectious, and malignant processes. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Point-of-care ultrasound will facilitate diagnosis in children with lymph node swelling and should be considered in children of all ages. While assessing the lymph node pathology at the bedside, describe the shape, size, internal echotexture, borders, vascularity, and the pattern of the perinodal soft tissue to differentiate between a normal, reactive, infectious, inflammatory, or malignant underlying pathology."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Recently a novel subtype of endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) defined by recurrent genomic alterations involving BCOR has been described (HGESS-BCOR). We identified a case of HGESS-BCOR with a ZC3H7B-BCOR gene fusion, which harbored an amplification of the MDM2 locus. This index case prompted us to investigate MDM2 amplification in four additional cases of HGESS-BCOR. Tumors were analyzed for MDM2 amplification by array-based profiling of copy number alterations (CNAs) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), as well as for MDM2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, a cohort of other mesenchymal uterine neoplasms, including 17 low-grade ESS, 6 classical high-grade ESS with YWHAE-rearrangement, 16 uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors, 7 uterine leiomyomas and 8 uterine leiomyosarcomas, was analyzed for CNAs in MDM2. Copy number profiling identified amplification of the 12q15 region involving the MDM2 locus in all five HGESS-BCOR. Subsequent validation analyses of three tumors confirmed MDM2 amplification using MDM2 FISH. Accordingly, IHC showed MDM2 overexpression in all analyzed cases. None of the other uterine neoplasms in our series, including tumors that are in the histopathological differential diagnoses of HGESS-BCOR, showed copy number gains of MDM2. Together, our results indicate that HGESS-BCOR carries MDM2 amplifications, which has diagnostic implications and could potentially be used for targeted therapies in these clinically aggressive tumors."

          "The transfer of critically ill children from intensive care units (ICUs) to their homes for palliation is seldom described. We report our 10-year pediatric palliative transport experience and conducted a survey to gain parents' perspectives of their child's transport experience. Over the study period, eight patients were transported from our pediatric ICU to their homes or hospice facilities. There were no intratransport adverse events. Parents who participated in the survey responded positively to the transport experience. The availability of a dedicated critical care transport service allowed for palliative transfers to be performed safely. Facilitating transport to allow withdrawal of life support at home is an acceptable option to families as part of holistic end-of-life care."

          "While there is increasing knowledge about the gut microbiome, the factors influencing and the significance of the gut resistome are still not well understood. Infant gut commensals risk transferring multidrug-resistant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to pathogenic bacteria. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is a worldwide public health concern. Better understanding of the na\u00efve infant gut resistome may build the evidence base for antimicrobial stewardship in both humans and in the food industry. Given the high carriage rate of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Asia, we aimed to evaluate community prevalence, dynamics, and longitudinal changes in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles and prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the intestinal microbiome of infants participating in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study, a longitudinal cohort study of pregnant women and their infants.",
          "We analysed ARGs in the first year of life among 75 infants at risk of eczema who had stool samples collected at multiple timepoints using metagenomics.",
          "The mean number of ARGs per infant increased with age. The most common ARGs identified confer resistance to aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics; all infants harboured these antibiotic resistance genes at some point in the first year of life. Few ARGs persisted throughout the first year of life. Beta-lactam resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected in 4 (5.3%) and 32 (42.7%) of subjects respectively.",
          "In this longitudinal cohort study of infants living in a region with high endemic antibacterial resistance, we demonstrate that majority of the infants harboured several antibiotic resistance genes in their gut and showed that the infant gut resistome is diverse and dynamic over the first year of life."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) monotherapy shows early promise for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in patients. Nevertheless, limited representative NPC models hamper preclinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of novel ICB and combination regimens. In the present study, we engrafted NPC biopsies in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain-null (NSG) mice and established humanized mouse NPC-patient-derived xenograft (NPC-PDX) model successfully. Epstein-Barr virus was detected in the NPC in both NSG and humanized mice as revealed by Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In the NPC-bearing humanized mice, the percentage of tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells was lowered, and the T cells expressed higher levels of various inhibitory receptors, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) than those in blood. The mice were then treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab, and the anti-tumor efficacy of combination immunotherapy was examined. In line with paired clinical data, the NPC-PDX did not respond to the treatment in terms of tumor burden, whilst an immunomodulatory response was elicited in the humanized mice. From our results, human proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly upregulated in plasma. After treatment, there was a decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio in the NPC-PDX, which also simulated the modulation of intratumoral CD4/CD8 profile from the corresponding donor. In addition, tumor-infiltrating T cells were re-activated and secreted more IFN-\u03b3 towards ex vivo stimulation, suggesting that other factors, including soluble mediators and metabolic milieu in tumor microenvironment may counteract the effect of ICB treatment and contribute to the tumor progression in the mice. Taken together, we have established and characterized a novel humanized mouse NPC-PDX model, which plausibly serves as a robust platform to test for the efficacy of immunotherapy and may predict clinical outcomes in NPC patients."

          "The purpose of this review is to analyze the evidence for use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with a focus on women, namely, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella, ventricular assist devices (VAD), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).",
          "There is paucity of data examining management options for cardiogenic shock (CS) in women specifically. In published data, although only a minority of MCS recipients (33%) were women, there is a trend toward even lower use in women relative to men over time. Women presenting with CS tend to have a higher risk profile including older age, greater comorbidities, higher Society of Cardiothoracic Surgery (STS) mortality scores, more hypotension and index vasopressor requirements, and longer duration of CS. Overall, women receiving mechanical support suffer increased bleeding and vascular complications and have higher 30-day readmission rates. The incidence of cardiogenic shock (CS) has been rising at a higher rate in women compared to men. Women in CS tend to present with an overall higher risk profile including older age, greater burden of medical comorbidities, more hypotension and index vasopressor requirements, higher STS mortality scores, and more out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. After adjusting for comorbidities and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, mortality remained higher in younger women compared to men of similar age. In spite of these facts, evidence points to the underutilization of support devices in eligible female patients. Higher complication rates, such as vascular complications requiring surgery and bleeding requiring transfusion, may be deterring factors that limit the use of MCS and hinderoperator confidence and experience with devices in women. This suggests that future research should address the sex disparities in outcomes of contemporary MCS practices."

          "Adolescents with type 1 diabetes face self-management challenges that make it difficult for them to achieve good glycemic control. In our population of adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improved patients' glycemic time in range (TIR) and identified hypoglycemia more frequently than with intermittent self-monitoring of blood glucose throughout a 4-week interval. However, the adolescents were unable to synthesize this information to problem-solve or reduce the frequency of hypoglycemic events. Setting SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) diabetes management goals and providing intensive diabetes education and support could increase adolescents' TIR and prevent hypoglycemia."

          "In animal studies early life antibiotic exposure causes metabolic abnormalities including obesity through microbiota disruption, but evidence from human studies is scarce. We examined involvement of gut microbiota in the associations between infant antibiotic exposure and childhood adiposity.",
          "Infant antibiotic exposure in the first year of life was ascertained using parental reports during interviewer-administered questionnaires. Primary outcomes were childhood obesity [body mass index (BMI) z-score\u2009>\u200995th percentile] and adiposity [abdominal circumference (AC) and skinfold (triceps\u2009+\u2009subscapular (SST)) measurements] determined from ages 15-60 months. At age 24 months, when the gut microbiota are more stable, stool samples (n\u2009=\u2009392) were collected for the gut microbiota profiling using co-abundancy networks. Associations of antibiotic exposure with obesity and adiposity (n\u2009=\u20091016) were assessed using multiple logistic and linear mixed effects regressions. Key bacteria associated with antibiotics exposure were identified by partial redundancy analysis and multivariate association with linear models.",
          "Antibiotic exposure was reported in 38% of study infants. In a fully adjusted model, a higher odds of obesity from 15-60 months of age was observed for any antibiotic exposure [OR(95% CI)\u2009=\u20091.45(1.001, 2.14)] and exposure to \u22653 courses of antibiotics [2.78(1.12, 6.87)]. For continuous adiposity indicators, any antibiotic exposure was associated with higher BMI z-score in boys [\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.15(0.01, 0.28)] but not girls [\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.04(-0.19, 0.11)] (P interaction\u2009=\u20090.026). Similarly, exposure to \u22653 courses of antibiotics was associated with higher AC in boys [1.15(0.05, 2.26)\u2009cm] but not girls [0.57(-1.32, 2.45)\u2009cm] (P interaction not significant). Repeated exposure to antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction (FDR-corrected P values\u2009<\u20090.05) in a microbial co-abundant group (CAG) represented by Eubacterium hallii, whose proportion was negatively correlated with childhood adiposity. Meanwhile, a CAG represented by Tyzzerella 4 was positively correlated with the repeated use of antibiotics and childhood adiposity.",

          "Singapore was one of the earliest countries affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with more laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in early February 2020 than any other country outside China. This short report is a narrative review of our tertiary paediatric emergency department (ED) perspective and experience managing the evolving outbreak situation. Logistic considerations included the segregation of the ED into physically separate high-risk, intermediate-risk and low-risk areas, with risk-adapted use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel in each ED area. Workflow considerations included the progressive introduction of outpatient COVID-19 testing in the ED for enhanced surveillance; adapting the admissions process particularly for high-risk and intermediate-risk cases; and the management of unwell accompanying adult caregivers. Manpower considerations included the reorganisation of medical manpower into modular teams to mitigate the risk of hospital transmission of COVID-19. Future plans for a tiered isolation facility should include structural modifications for the permanent isolation facility such as anterooms for PPE donning/doffing; replication of key ED functions in the tent facility such as a separate resuscitation room and portable X-ray room; and refresher PPE training. Dynamic reassessment of ED workflow processes, in conjunction with the hospital and national public health response, may help in managing this novel disease entity."

          "Tracheal intubation in critically ill children with shock poses a risk of hemodynamic compromise. Ketamine has been considered the drug of choice for induction in these patients, but limited data exist. We investigated whether the administration of ketamine for tracheal intubation in critically ill children with or without shock was associated with fewer adverse hemodynamic events compared with other induction agents. We also investigated if there was a dose dependence for any association between ketamine use and adverse hemodynamic events.",
          "We performed a retrospective analysis using prospectively collected observational data from the National Emergency Airway Registry for Children database from 2013 to 2017.",
          "Forty international PICUs participating in the National Emergency Airway Registry for Children.",
          "Critically ill children 0-17 years old who underwent tracheal intubation in a PICU.",
          "None.",
          "The association between ketamine exposure as an induction agent and the occurrence of adverse hemodynamic events during tracheal intubation including dysrhythmia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest was evaluated. We used multivariable logistic regression to account for patient, provider, and practice factors with robust SEs to account for clustering by sites. Of 10,750 tracheal intubations, 32.0% (n = 3,436) included ketamine as an induction agent. The most common diagnoses associated with ketamine use were sepsis and/or shock (49.7%). After adjusting for potential confounders and sites, ketamine use was associated with fewer hemodynamic tracheal intubation associated adverse events compared with other agents (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.95). The interaction term between ketamine use and indication for shock was not significant (p = 0.11), indicating ketamine effect to prevent hemodynamic adverse events is consistent in children with or without shock.",

          "Despite development of new technologies for caries control, tooth decay in primary teeth remains a major global health problem. Caries risk assessment (CRA) models for toddlers and preschoolers are rare. Among them, almost all models use dental factors (e.g., past caries experience) to predict future caries risk, with limited clinical/community applicability owing to relatively uncommon dental visits compared to frequent medical visits during the first year of life. The objective of this study was to construct and evaluate risk prediction models using information easily accessible to medical practitioners to forecast caries at 2 and 3 y of age. Data were obtained from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) mother-offspring cohort. Caries was diagnosed using modified International Caries Detection and Assessment System criteria. Risk prediction models were constructed using multivariable logistic regression coupled with receiver operating characteristic analyses. Imputation was performed using multiple imputation by chained equations to assess effect of missing data. Caries rates at ages 2 y (<i>n</i> = 535) and 3 y (<i>n</i> = 721) were 17.8% and 42.9%, respectively. Risk prediction models predicting overall caries risk at 2 and 3 y demonstrated area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) of 0.81 (0.75-0.87) and 0.79 (0.74-0.84), respectively, while those predicting moderate to extensive lesions showed 0.91 (0.85-0.97) and 0.79 (0.73-0.85), respectively. Postimputation results showed reduced AUC of 0.75 (0.74-0.81) and 0.71 (0.67-0.75) at years 2 and 3, respectively, for overall caries risk, while AUC was 0.84 (0.76-0.92) and 0.75 (0.70-0.80), respectively, for moderate to extensive caries. Addition of anterior caries significantly increased AUC in all year 3 models with or without imputation (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Significant predictors/protectors were identified, including ethnicity, prenatal tobacco smoke exposure, history of allergies before 12 mo, history of chronic maternal illness, maternal brushing frequency, childbearing age, and so on. Integrating oral-general health care using medical CRA models may be promising in screening caries-susceptible infants/toddlers, especially when medical professionals are trained to \"lift the lip\" to identify anterior caries lesions."

          "Progressive tension suture (PTS) technique in cosmetic abdominoplasty is safe in terms of seroma rates. This was extrapolated to deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap donor site closure. No study to our knowledge has analyzed the PTS technique alone without drains in transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap donor sites. We aim to show that no-drain closure has similar complication rates and this may be applied to TRAM flaps safely even though they have higher drain output.",
          "A single-center, single-surgeon retrospective study was performed over 4 years. Patients undergoing breast reconstruction with an abdominal flap were included. Data collected included patient's demographics, type of flap, usage of drains or PTS technique, drain output, date of fitness for discharge, date of discharge, and seroma rates. The outcomes studied were drain volumes, seroma rates, and duration of hospital stay.",
          "Fifty patients were recruited. The first 25 patients (13 DIEP and 12 TRAM) underwent conventional closure. The subsequent 25 patients (17 DIEP and 8 TRAM) underwent PTS technique. TRAM flaps had higher drain volume (785.6 mL) compared to DIEP flaps (366.2 mL) (<i>P</i> = 0.047). No patients developed a seroma. Patients who underwent the PTS technique had lower abdominal-specific complications (<i>P</i> = 0.021). Patients without drains were discharged faster at 5.4 versus 8.2 days (<i>P</i> \u2264 0.001).",
          "Patients who underwent the PTS technique had lower complication rates, faster time to fitness for discharge and shorter hospitalization stay. The PTS technique may be applied to TRAM flaps safely."

          "Epidemics and pandemics from zoonotic respiratory viruses, such as the 2019 novel coronavirus, can lead to significant global intensive care burden as patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A subset of these patients developed refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarise the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics.",
          "A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications.",
          "Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimised while receiving ECMO so as to minimise ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation.",
          "The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection."

          "We aim to compare live birth rates, cost analysis and a survey of patient attitudes between laparosopic tubal re-anastomosis and in vitro fertilisation (IVF).",
          "A retrospective study was done in a single reproductive medicine and IVF unit in Singapore from January 2011 to December 2016. Previously ligated patients underwent either laparoscopic tubal re-anastomosis or IVF. The primary outcome was first live birth after treatment. Interval to first pregnancy, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies were also reported. Patients attending the subfertility clinic completed a questionnaire on IVF and tubal re-anastomosis on preferred choice of treatment, before and after reading an information sheet.",
          "Twelve patients underwent tubal re-anastomosis while 31 patients underwent IVF treatment. Pregnancy (75.0% vs 35.5%) and live birth (58.3% vs 25.8%) were significantly higher in the tubal surgery group (<i>P</i> <0.05%) after transferring all available embryos in one stimulated IVF cycle. Cost per live birth was lower in the tubal surgery group (SGD27,109 vs SGD52,438). One hundred patients participated in the survey. A majority of patients preferred tubal surgery to IVF (68.2% vs 31.8%) before given information on the procedures, but indicated a preference for IVF (54.6%) to surgery (45.4%) after receiving information on the procedures.",
          "For women less than 40 years of age, desiring fertility after tubal ligation, laparoscopic tubal re-anastomosis offers better live birth rates and cost-effectiveness. Patients in Singapore are equivocal as to their preference after education regarding the choices. Thus, laparoscopic tubal re-anastomosis remains a viable alternative to IVF treatment."

These lesions are benign and are considered to be non-pathological variants of normal deep parenchymal veins. Although most of them are asymptomatic, a small subset of them located in aqueductal region have been reported to cause obstructive hydrocephalus. The authors present an interesting case of biventricular hydrocephalus secondary to a DVA located on the proximal aqueduct in an adolescent patient. This case is discussed with in corroboration with current literature and management recommendations."

We report 2 patients diagnosed with subserosal adenomyotic cysts and peritoneal inclusion cysts, mimicking multiloculated pelvic tumors. We discuss their clinical presentation, investigations, operation findings, and histopathology, present a literature review.",
          "Case 1 was a 44-year-old patient with abnormal uterine bleeding. Imaging showed an enlarging multiloculated cystic structure over the right uterine wall. She underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy and right salpingo-ophorectomy. Intra-operatively, she was found to have multiple subserosal uterine cysts, diagnosed as adenomyotic cysts on histology.Case 2 was a 50-year-old patient with history of laparoscopic cystectomy done 20\u00a0years ago. She was incidentally found to have a multiloculated cystic lesion in the pelvis. The lesion was located midline, anterior and superior to the uterus and bladder. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy, and bladder peritonectomy. Intra-operatively, multiple cystic lesions were noted over the anterior and fundus of uterus, bladder peritoneum, and pelvic side walls. The condition was confirmed to be peritoneal inclusion cysts on histology.",
          "Subserosal adenomyotic cysts are a rare presentation of adenomyosis. They typically occur in premenopausal women. Treatment is usually by hormonal medications or surgical excision.Many patients with peritoneal inclusion cysts have a history of peritoneal insults. Surgical excision is the most commonly described management as they often mimic malignancy. Both conditions are unusual presentations of multiloculated pelvic masses. A high recurrence rate is found, hence long-term follow-up with imaging is essential."

          "Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of completed gestation) is the leading cause of neonatal death, and has an incidence of 5-13% which is believed to be on the rise. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of spontaneous preterm birth and investigate the relationship between preterm birth and cervical length in a pregnant Asian population.",
          "A prospective observational study between September 2010 and November 2013 was performed at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. 1013 women with single viable pregnancies were recruited at less than 14 weeks of gestation between September 2010 and November 2013, excluding those with multiple gestation, pre-existing autoimmune or renal disease or those with current pregnancies complicated by aneuploidy or fetal anomalies. Participant characteristics were obtained from an interviewer-administered questionnaire at the first recruitment visit. Cervical length was measured using ultrasound at each of the 4 antenatal visits (Visit 1: < 14 weeks, Visit 2: 18-22 weeks, Visit 3: 28-32 weeks and Visit 4: > 34 weeks) using the Fetal Medicine Foundation protocol. Data on pregnancy outcomes were obtained from obstetric case notes and records. The main outcome measure examined in this study was that of spontaneous preterm birth and its relationship to cervical length.",
          "There was a significantly shorter cervical length both in the 2nd trimester (18 to 22 weeks) and the 3rd trimester (28 to 32 weeks) in the preterm birth group compared to the term birth group (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001 respectively). In the first trimester (11 to 14 weeks), there was no statistically significant difference in cervical length between the two groups (p = 0.425). ROC curve analysis for cervical length in the preterm birth group for 18 to 22 weeks and 28 to 32 weeks showed an AUC of 0.605 and 0.725 respectively. At 28 to 32 weeks of gestation, a cut-off level at 2.49 cm has a sensitivity of 54.8%, specificity of 82.5%, negative predictive value of 97.9% and positive predictive value of 11.1%.",
          "There is a significantly shorter cervical length in the 2nd and 3rd trimester in the preterm birth group. Cervical length is a moderate predictor of preterm birth with good negative predictive value and a relatively good specificity. Ultrasound cervical length screening for pregnant Asian women between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation with a cutoff of \u2265 2.48cm can help to identify a group of women who are at risk for preterm birth."

          "The incidence of paediatric glioblastoma is uncommon in comparison to their adult counterpart. Even more infrequent are extraneural metastases in glioblastoma. A previously well 14-year-old female presented with progressive right hemiparesis secondary to a left fronto-temporal lobe glioblastoma (WHO IV). She underwent successful gross total resection for her brain tumour. Prior to commencement of her adjuvant treatment, she developed tumour recurrence associated with intra-lesional haemorrhage. Although she underwent a second surgery, the patient developed bilateral malignant pleural effusion secondary to extraneural pulmonary metastases. Early awareness of its existence enables prompt diagnosis for this devastating disease. The authors emphasize the urgent need for international collaborations to work together for children affected by this challenging brain tumour."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common birth defect associated with significant mortality and morbidity. There is limited outcome data on CDH in the Southeast Asian region. Rapid accessibility to our CDH Perinatal Center, as a consequence of the small geographic size of our country and efficient land transportation system, has largely eliminated deaths of live outborn babies prior arrival at our center. We selected a study period when extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was not available at our institution. The data will therefore be relevant in developing management guidelines and antenatal counselling for perinatal centers in this region managing CDH with limited resources, without ECMO facilities.",
          "A retrospective study of antenatally or postnatally diagnosed CDH infants born between January 2002 and June 2005 was performed. We selected this study period as ECMO support was not available over this period. We studied the demographics, clinical characteristics, postnatal predictors of mortality and outcomes of CDH infants in a single tertiary institution.",
          "A total of 24 patients with CDH were identified. Seventy-nine percent of liveborns with CDH survived to hospital discharge. Antenatal detection rate was 83.3%. Significant postnatal predictors of mortality were preoperative pneumothorax (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), high CRIB score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), low one- and five-minute Apgar score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026 respectively) and high pCO2 on initial arterial blood gas (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). At one-year follow-up, three patients had delayed gross motor milestones which resolved subsequently. Re-admissions were required for recurrent bronchiolitis (33%) and oesophageal reflux which resolved in all cases. Two (13.3%) infants had surgical complications and needed re-admission for probable adhesive intestinal obstruction; one required adhesiolysis and the other was managed conservatively with good outcome.",
          "A single-center CDH outcome in Singapore, without ECMO use, was good. This is a cohort now with long-term survival outcome which will be valuable to the neonatology community."

All patients had at least 15\u00a0months of follow-up. There was no\u00a0significant difference in mean spherical equivalent (SE) (p\u2009=\u20090.341), age (p\u2009=\u20090.699), gender (p\u2009=\u20090.815) and ethnicity (p\u2009=\u20090.922) among the three groups at baseline. Patients were reviewed at 3, 9 and 15\u00a0months. Over a 15-month period, the mean change in SE was 0.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70\u00a0D, 0.51\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70\u00a0D and 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.76\u00a0D in the patients started on once, twice and thrice per week, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.342). Further analysis was performed by dividing patients into three groups of different changes in SE at the 15-month mark-\u2264\u20090.5\u00a0D, between 0.5\u00a0D and 1.0\u00a0D and\u2009>\u20091.0\u00a0D. Groups with less myopic progression at the 15-month mark (<\u20090.5 and 0.5 to 1.0\u00a0D groups) were more myopic, -\u20095.32\u00a0D\u2009\u00b1\u20091.88 and -\u20095.21\u00a0D\u2009\u00b1\u20091.76, respectively, compared to -\u20094.13\u00a0D\u2009\u00b1\u20092.05 in the\u2009>\u20091.0 D group. Multivariate linear regression analysis confirmed this relationship (p\u2009=\u20090.005), after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and frequency of dose.",

          "To evaluate the difference in oncologic outcome between vulvar cancer patients with uni- and bilateral inguino-femoral lymph nodal involvement and to identify factors affecting their oncologic outcome MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent inguino-femoral lymphadenectomy for vulvar cancer were classified into three groups according to their lymph nodal status at the histology analysis (negative, positive one side, positive bilaterally). PFS and OS survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze factors predicting overall survival and progression-free survival. Multivariable models were used for variables reporting a p value\u2009\u2264\u20090.1 at the univariate analysis. p values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant.",
          "One hundred and forty-six patients were considered for the analysis. Patients with bilaterally negative lymph nodes had significantly longer PFS and OS as compared to patients with unilateral and bilateral involvement. Patients with unilateral lymph nodal involvement had better PFS than patients with bilateral lymph nodal involvement. Among these patients, the difference in the OS approached but did not reach statistical significance. At the multivariate analysis, the tumor size affected PFS and lymph nodal involvement affected OS.",
          "Vulvar cancer patients with bilateral positive lymph nodes have worse oncologic outcome as compared to patients with unilateral lymph nodal involvement; similarly, patients with unilateral lymph nodal involvement have worse oncological outcome as compared to patients with bilateral negative lymph nodes. Furthermore, tumor size and lymph nodal status are independent factors predicting recurrence rate and overall survival, respectively."

          "Perinatal transmission remains one of the important causes of the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Over the years, with better knowledge and awareness of HIV, the perinatal transmission rate has been significantly reduced. We previously reported on the pregnancy outcomes of HIV-positive mothers from 1997 to 2007 in our institution. This paper aims to review standards of care of HIV-positive pregnant women since then.",
          "A retrospective study reviewed 84 HIV-positive women who delivered in a tertiary centre from January 2008 to December 2015. Patient demographics and antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal and immediate neonatal data were analysed.",
          "There were a total of 97 deliveries with 98 neonates. 12 women delivered more than once and there was one set of twins. Mean maternal age at diagnosis of HIV was 27.8 years. Of the study population, 63.1% of women were non-Singaporeans. 56 women were known to have HIV on presentation and 90.7% were on antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. 88.7% of the women received intrapartum intravenous zidovudine, and 93.1% of women with detectable and 58.7% with undetectable viral load underwent Caesarean sections. All neonates were HIV-negative.",

          "Natural killer (NK) cells are one of the main effector populations of immunotherapy with monoclonal antibody and cytokines, used in combination with chemotherapy to treat children with high-risk neuroblastoma on this phase II trial. However, the impact of chemoimmunotherapy on NK cell kinetics, phenotype, and function is understudied.",
          "We prospectively examined NK cell properties from 63 children with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma enrolled in a phase II trial (NCT01857934) and correlated our findings with tumor volume reduction after 2 courses of chemoimmunotherapy. NK cell studies were conducted longitudinally during chemoimmunotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) with optional haploidentical NK cell infusion and additional immunotherapy.",
          "Chemoimmunotherapy led to significant NK cytopenia, but complete NK cell recovery reliably occurred by day 21 of each therapy course as well as after autoHCT. Haploidentical NK cell infusion elevated the NK cell count transiently during autoHCT. NK cell cytotoxicity increased significantly during treatment compared with diagnosis. In addition, NK cells maintained their ability to respond to cytokine stimulation in culture longitudinally. Unsupervised cluster analysis of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell count and tumor volume at diagnosis and after two courses of chemoimmunotherapy identified two patient groups with distinct primary tumor sizes and therapy responses.",
          "After profound NK cytopenia due to chemoimmunotherapy, endogenously reconstituted NK cells exhibit enhanced NK cytotoxicity compared with pretherapy measurements. Our data suggest a relationship between CD56<sup>bright</sup> expression and tumor size before and after two courses of chemoimmunotherapy; however, future studies are necessary to confirm this relationship and its predictive significance.",

          "Assays of salivary biomarkers for diagnosis are gaining popularity in pediatric diseases due to their non-invasive nature. Our pilot project aims to evaluate the utility of salivary leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG) in the diagnosis of pediatric acute appendicitis (AA).",
          "We prospectively recruited 34 patients, aged between 4 and 16\u00a0years, admitted with acute abdominal pain suspicious of appendicitis. The patients' demography, clinical characteristics, laboratory investigations, imaging examination results, operative findings, and discharge diagnoses were recorded. We compared the diagnostic performance of the patients' total white counts, neutrophil percentages, C-reactive protein, and saliva LRG levels. Saliva samples were obtained using the SalivaBio Children's Swab and LRG levels were quantified using a commercially available LRG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. IRB approval was obtained.",
          "Seventeen patients had a confirmed diagnosis of appendicitis on histology. Another 17 were confirmed not to have appendicitis after a minimum of 24\u00a0h of hospitalization, with further verification via telephone interview 2\u00a0weeks later. The median levels of saliva LRG were elevated in patients with AA as compared to those without (P\u2009=\u20090.008). At a cutoff of LRG 0.33\u00a0ng/\u03bcg, we obtained a diagnostic specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 35.3%.",
          "Our proof-of-concept study demonstrated the diagnostic potential of saliva LRG for appendicitis in children. The distinct advantage of saliva LRG assays is that the procedure is simple, pain-free, and requires no specialized skill. Further study with a larger cohort is needed to verify our results."

          "Gestational diabetes is associated with unfavorable body fat distribution in offspring. However, less is known about the effects across the range of maternal gestational glycemia on offspring abdominal adiposity (AA) in infancy and early childhood.",
          "This study determined the association between gestational glycemia and offspring AA measured by MRI in the neonatal period and during the preschool years.",
          "Participants were mother-offspring pairs from the GUSTO (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes) prospective cohort study. Children who underwent MRI within 2 wk postdelivery (n\u00a0=\u00a0305) and/or at preschool age, 4.5 y (n\u00a0=\u00a0273), and whose mothers had a 2-h 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) at 26-28 weeks of gestation were included. AA measured by adipose tissue compartment volumes-abdominal superficial (sSAT), deep subcutaneous (dSAT), and internal (IAT) adipose tissue-was quantified from MRI images.",
          "Adjusting for potential confounders including maternal prepregnancy BMI, each 1-mmol/L increase in maternal fasting glucose was associated with higher SD scores for sSAT (0.66; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.86), dSAT (0.65; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.87), and IAT (0.64; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.86) in neonates. Similarly, each 1-mmol/L increase in 2-h OGTT glucose was associated with higher neonatal sSAT (0.11; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.19) and dSAT (0.09; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.17). These associations were stronger in female neonates but only persisted in girls between fasting glucose, and sSAT and dSAT at 4.5 y.",
          "A positive association between maternal glycemia and neonatal AA was observed across the whole range of maternal mid-gestation glucose concentrations. These findings may lend further support to efforts toward optimizing maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy. The study also provides suggestive evidence on sex differences in the impact of maternal glycemia, which merits further confirmation in other studies.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875."

          "Several risk factors in the first 1000 d are linked with increased obesity risk in later childhood. The role of potentially modifiable eating behaviors in this association is unclear.",
          "This study examined whether the association between cumulated risk factors in the first 1000 d and adiposity at 6 y is moderated by eating behaviors.",
          "Participants were 302 children from the GUSTO (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes) cohort. Risk factors included maternal prepregnancy and paternal overweight, excessive gestational weight gain, raised fasting plasma glucose during pregnancy, short breastfeeding duration, and early introduction of solid foods. Composite risk scores reflecting the prevalence and the importance of the risk factors present were computed. Adiposity outcomes were child BMI and sum of skinfolds (SSF), and candidate eating behavior moderators were portion size, eating rate, and energy intake during lunch and in an eating in the absence of hunger task.",
          "Higher composite risk score predicted higher BMI z scores (B\u00a0=\u00a00.08; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.13) and larger SSF (0.70 mm; 0.23, 1.18 mm), and was associated with larger self-served food portions (5.03 kcal; 0.47, 9.60 kcal), faster eating rates (0.40 g/min; 0.21, 0.59 g/min), and larger lunch intakes (7.05 kcal; 3.37, 10.74 kcal). Importantly, the association between composite risk score and adiposity was moderated by eating behaviors. The composite risk score was unrelated to SSF in children who selected smaller food portions, ate slower, and consumed less energy, but was positively associated with SSF among children who selected larger food portions, ate faster, and consumed more energy (eating behavior \u00d7 risk score interactions: P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).",
          "The association between risk factors in the first 1000 d and adiposity at 6 y varies by eating behaviors, highlighting modifiable behavioral targets for interventions.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875."

          "Pre-operative association factors (pain and psychological vulnerability) could significantly contribute to post-Cesarean pain; however, limited information is available on the development of postnatal depression (PND). We aimed to investigate the development of PND and its association with pain vulnerability and psychological vulnerability factors.",
          "Women undergoing Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were given pre-operative questionnaires, psychological and pain assessments including pain on local anesthetic injection during spinal anesthesia and mechanical temporal summation. Post-operative assessments were administered at 6 to 10 weeks post-Cesarean delivery via follow-up survey to assess post-Cesarean psychological and pain outcomes.",
          "PND occurred in 21.1% (43 of 205) of patients who underwent elective Cesarean delivery. An increased pre-operative pain score with movement (Odds ratio (OR) 1.65, 95% CI 1.12-2.44, p = 0.0110), anxiety about upcoming surgery (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.04, p = 0.0429), higher pre-operative Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscale on anxiety (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.45, p = 0.0041) and higher pre-operative central sensitization inventory (CSI) scores (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.0156) were independently associated with an increased risk of PND. Anticipated pain medication needs were associated with reduced risk of PND (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.79, p = 0.0038) (Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) = 0.8177).",
          "Higher pre-operative anxiety, pain score, central sensitization and lower anticipated pain medication needs were associated with increased risks of PND. Further work using larger sample size will be needed to validate the model in predicting PND development after Cesarean delivery."

          "Although refill adherence measures (RAMs) are widely reviewed on their use among adult patients, existing reviews on adherence among children have only focused on self-report measures and electronic monitoring. Hence, this systematic review aims to examine the use of RAMs and their association with economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes (ECHO) among pediatric patients. A literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Studies published in English involving subjects aged \u226418 years were included if RAMs were analyzed with ECHO. Of the 35 included studies, the majority (n = 33) were conducted in high-income countries. Asthma was the most common condition (n = 9) studied. Overall, 60.6% of 33 clinical outcomes reported among 22 studies was positive (improved clinical outcomes with improved adherence), while 21.9% of 32 economic outcomes reported among 16 studies was positive (reduced healthcare utilization or cost outcomes with improved adherence). Only four studies evaluated the relationship of adherence with 11 humanistic outcomes, where the majority (72.7%) were considered unclear. RAMs are associated with ECHO and can be considered for use in the pediatric population. Future studies could explore the use of RAMs in low-income countries, and the association of RAMs with quality of life."

          "Ventilator and blood gas data were collected for the first 7 days of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and compared between the protocol (n = 63) and nonprotocol groups (n = 69). After implementation of the protocol, median tidal volume (6.4 mL/kg [5.4-7.8 mL/kg] vs 6.0 mL/kg [4.8-7.3 mL/kg]; p = 0.005), PaO2 (78.1 mm Hg [67.0-94.6 mm Hg] vs 74.5 mm Hg [59.2-91.1 mm Hg]; p = 0.001), and oxygen saturation (97% [95-99%] vs 96% [94-98%]; p = 0.007) were lower, and end-expiratory pressure (8 cm H2O [7-9 cm H2O] vs 8 cm H2O [8-10 cm H2O]; p = 0.002] and PaCO2 (44.9 mm Hg [38.8-53.1 mm Hg] vs 46.4 mm Hg [39.4-56.7 mm Hg]; p = 0.033) were higher, in keeping with lung protective measures. There was no difference in mortality (10/63 [15.9%] vs 18/69 [26.1%]; p = 0.152), ventilator-free days (16.0 [2.0-23.0] vs 19.0 [0.0-23.0]; p = 0.697), and PICU-free days (13.0 [0.0-21.0] vs 16.0 [0.0-22.0]; p = 0.233) between the protocol and nonprotocol groups. After adjusting for severity of illness, organ dysfunction and oxygenation index, the lung-protective mechanical ventilation protocol was associated with decreased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.88).",

          "Eye examination in distressed young children can be challenging in a busy emergency department. A full, detailed evaluation is, however, often needed in ocular emergencies.",
          "A 2-year-old boy presented to our pediatric emergency department with refusal to open his left eye for 1\u00a0day. Eye examination was difficult and yielded limited findings, despite analgesia and parental facilitation. Under such circumstances, this might require sedation or forcibly everting the child's eyelids for the eye evaluation. A rapid ocular point-of-care ultrasound was performed, which revealed sonographic findings suggestive of a retinoblastoma in the left eye. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The use of ocular point-of-care ultrasound facilitated the diagnosis of retinoblastoma in a child who was highly distressed and difficult to examine. Its use under such circumstances facilitated the patient's prompt evaluation and subsequent management."

          "Information technology applications for patient-collection of family health history (FHH) increase identification of elevated-risk individuals compared to usual care. It is unknown if the method of collection impacts data collected or if simply going directly to the patient is what makes the difference. The objective of this study was to examine differences in data detail and risk identification rates between FHH collection directly from individuals using paper-based forms and an interactive web-based platform. This is a non-randomized epidemiologic study in Singaporean population from 2016 to 2018. Intervention was paper-based versus web-based interactive platform for FHH collection. Participant demographics, FHH detail, and risk assessment results were analyzed. 882 participants enrolled in the study, 481 in the paper-based group and 401 in the web-based group with mean (SD) age of 45.4 (12.98) years and 47.5% male. Web-based FHH collection participants had an increased number of conditions per relative (p-value <0.001), greater frequency of reporting age of onset (p-value <0.001), and greater odds of receiving \u22651 risk recommendation both overall (OR: 3.99 (2.41, 6.59)) and within subcategories of genetic counselling for hereditary cancer syndromes (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.041) and screening and prevention for breast (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and colon cancer (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.005). This has significant implications for clinical care and research efforts where FHH is being assessed. Using interactive information technology platforms to collect FHH can improve the completeness of the data collected and result in increased rates of risk identification. Methods of data collection to maximize benefit should be taken into account in future studies and clinical care."

          "A woman in her early twenties with dichorionic diamniotic twins underwent emergency caesarean section (CS) for failed induction of labor for discordant growth at 37 weeks. Her CS was complicated by atonic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) requiring uterotonics, B-lynch suture, and Bakri balloon. She presented on the 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day (POD) with fever and wound pain and collapsed due to desaturation. Investigations confirmed ascites on computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen and cardiomyopathy on echocardiogram. She was readmitted on the 22<sup>nd</sup> POD with watery vaginal discharge. CT abdomen revealed a dehisced CS scar and loculated ascites. Her discharge settled after three weeks with antibiotics and drainage of the ascites. A CT scan 3 months later showed reduction of the peritoneal collection. Caesarean scar dehiscence should be considered for patients presenting with ascites and vaginal discharge after a CS, particularly in the presence of risk factors such as infection or anemia."

          "This study aimed to examine prospective associations of mobile touch screen device (i.e. smartphone, tablet) use and patterns of use with musculoskeletal symptoms and visual health among adolescents. A representative sample of 1691 adolescents in Singapore (51% girls; 10-19 years) completed an online questionnaire at baseline and one-year follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, prospective associations were found between baseline smartphone use and follow-up neck/shoulder (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.61(95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.06-2.44)) and low back (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.86(1.10-3.14)) symptoms; tablet use was also associated with neck/shoulder, low back and arms symptoms (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.33(1.04-1.71)to1.52(1.18-1.95)). No associations were observed between the duration of smartphone/tablet use and symptoms. Baseline patterns of use (bout length, certain types of activities, multitasking) were associated with follow-up musculoskeletal symptoms. Smartphone/tablet use was not related to visual outcomes (visual symptoms, wearing glasses/contact lenses, myopia) at follow-up. These findings suggest that patterns of smartphone/tablet use (though not the duration of use) can pose a prospective risk for musculoskeletal symptoms."

          "Data collection included self-reported questionnaires of the Pediatric Inventory for Parents and the Coping Health Inventory for Parents across three time points. Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale was administered at hospital discharge (time point II). The utilization of health services and support was reported at post discharge (time point III). One-hundred mothers participated in this study between May 2016 and July 2017. Their mean age was 35.8 years (SD = 7.0), and the mean age of their children was 3.7 years (SD = 4.6). There was significant reduction in mean stress difficulty (Pediatric Inventory for Parents) of mothers (F = 4.58; p = 0.013) from time point I to III. No significant changes were found in the overall mean coping score (Coping Health Inventory for Parents) of mothers across time. The mean overall score for the readiness for discharge (Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale) of mothers at hospital discharge was 207.34 (SD = 29.22). Coping through family integration subscale and communication stress predicted discharge readiness of mothers (adjusted R = 0.11; p = 0.034). Mothers who reported higher overall stress (Pediatric Inventory for Parents) 2 weeks post discharge were more likely to call a friend or family member, visit the emergency department, or have their child readmitted to hospital following hospital discharge.",
          "We identified coping by family integration and communication-related stress as predictors of readiness for discharge. Strategies targeted at communication and family integration for discharge preparation may improve caregivers' readiness for hospital discharge."

          "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified wire loop technique for retrograde stent exchange.",
          "All patients were from the KK Women and Children's Hospital where there is no on-site urology service. Patients were identified retrospectively from the institutional radiological information system (RIS) database. In total, 270 stents were removed and 238 replaced for 79 patients between January 2012 to December 2016. Success rates for stent removal and exchange as well as skin dose and fluoroscopy time were assessed.",
          "Stent exchange was successful in 234/238 (98%) of cases. Failure was due to loss of access (one case), inability to snare stent due to distorted anatomy (two cases), and extensive encrustation of stent (one case). In 252/270 (93%) cases, stent was removed using modified snare while in 18 (7%) cases, other snare devices were used. Average fluoroscopy time per stent for stent exchange was 573 seconds and average skin dose was 12,494 DAP/mGy\u2022cm<sup>2</sup>.",
          "Fluoroscopy-guided retrograde ureteric stent exchange using the modified snare loop technique is effective, quick, and can be performed easily with equipment used in daily intervention practice. It may also be coupled with ureteroplasty, which may help the patient achieve eventual stent-free status."

          "Constipation is common in infants and children. Helping parents understand the vicious cycle of childhood chronic constipation is the key to successful management. Weaning, toilet training, transitions to kindergarten/school, a bout of febrile illness and overseas holidays are common life milestones that may be associated with an increased risk of constipation. A detailed history and targeted physical examination can rule out most organic causes of chronic constipation. Infrequent defecation (\u2264 2 per week), faecal incontinence, retentive posturing, painful or hard bowel movements or large diameter of stool suggest functional constipation. The Bristol stool chart is a free, useful tool for parents or caregivers to report and monitor the child's stools. Red flags in constipation include delayed passage of meconium beyond 48 hours of life, associated intestinal obstruction symptoms, developmental delays, behavioural problems and frequent soiling of underwear. Behavioural modifications should be considered in primary care, together with pharmacotherapy such as laxatives."

          "Individual differences in children's eating behaviours emerge early. We examined the relationship between breastfeeding exposure and subsequent eating behaviours among children from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. Children (n\u00a0=\u00a0970) were grouped according to their breastfeeding exposure: high (full breastfeeding\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 months with continued breastfeeding\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 months), low (any breastfeeding\u00a0<\u00a03 months or no breastfeeding) and intermediate (between low and high breastfeeding categories). Aspects of eating behaviour from ages 15 months to 6 years were captured using a combination of maternal reports (Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire; Infant Feeding Questionnaire; Preschooler Feeding Questionnaire) and laboratory-based measures of meal size, oral processing behaviours (e.g. average eating speed and bite size) and tendency to eat in the absence of hunger. Most children had low (44%) or intermediate (44%) breastfeeding exposure; only 12% had high exposure. After adjusting for confounders, multivariable linear regression analyses indicated the high (but not intermediate) breastfeeding group was associated with significantly lower reported food fussiness at 3 years compared to low breastfeeding group (-0.38 [-0.70, -0.06]), with similar but non-significant trends observed at 6 years (-0.27 [-0.66, 0.11]). At 3 years, mothers in the high breastfeeding group also reported the least difficulty in child feeding compared to low breastfeeding group (-0.22 [-0.43, -0.01]). However, high breastfeeding was not associated with any other maternal-reports of child feeding or eating behaviours, and no significant associations were observed between breastfeeding exposure and any of the laboratory measures of eating behaviour at any of the time points. These results do not strongly support the view that increased breastfeeding exposure alone has lasting and consistent associations with eating behaviours in early childhood."

          "The concurrent sampling design was developed for case-control studies of recurrent events. It involves matching for time. Standard conditional logistic-regression (CLR) analysis ignores the dependence among recurrent events. Existing methods for clustered observations for CLR do not fit the complex data structure arising from the concurrent sampling design.",
          "We propose to break the matches, apply unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for time in quintiles and residual time within each quintile, and use a robust standard error for observations clustered within persons. We conducted extensive simulation to evaluate this approach and compared it with methods based on CLR. We analysed data from a study of childhood pneumonia to illustrate the methods.",
          "The proposed method and CLR methods gave very similar point estimates of association and showed little bias. The proposed method produced confidence intervals that achieved the target level of coverage probability, whereas the CLR methods did not, except when disease incidence was low.",
          "The proposed method is suitable for the analysis of case-control studies with recurrent events."

          "Progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF), which plays an important role in maintaining healthy pregnancies, has shown great promise as a prognostic biomarker for threatened miscarriage. To better characterise the physiological trends of progesterone and PIBF, we analysed serum progesterone and PIBF concentrations in healthy non-pregnant and pregnant women across trimesters. We saw increasing concentrations of progesterone and PIBF in pregnant women with advancing trimesters. The serum progesterone and PIBF percentiles across gestational age in healthy pregnancies can be used as a guide for the formulation of reference ranges. We also demonstrated a significant positive correlation between progesterone and PIBF levels. This study demonstrates increasing progesterone and PIBF concentrations in later trimesters and underscores the importance of progesterone and PIBF in healthy pregnancies. Characterisation of progesterone and PIBF across gestational age in healthy pregnant women may help to prognosticate pregnancy viability and support further research into the importance of progesterone and PIBF in the maintenance of healthy pregnancies."

          "Optimal nutrition in children with severe bronchiolitis remains poorly described. We aimed to describe nutritional status and practices in children with severe bronchiolitis requiring admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and explore their associations with outcomes.",
          "We conducted a retrospective study on patients with bronchiolitis requiring PICU stay from 2009 to 2014. Demographics, medical data, and baseline weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ) were collected. In patients requiring more than 48\u2009hours of PICU stay, nutritional intake data in the first 3 days of PICU stay were collected. Underfeeding and overfeeding were defined as the median energy intake of less than 80% and more than 120% of requirements, respectively. Protein adequacy was defined as intake of more than 1.5\u2009g/kg/d. Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were the duration of PICU stay and mechanical ventilation (MV), respectively.",
          "Seventy-four patients were included, with a median PICU stay of 4.9 days (interquartile range 2.0-8.2). Low WLZ at baseline was associated with longer duration of PICU stay (adjusted \u03b2: 4.33 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-8.18]; P\u2009=\u2009.028) and MV days (adjusted \u03b2: 4.87 [95% CI, 1.56-8.18]; P\u2009=\u2009.008) compared to appropriate WLZ. In patients with \u226548\u2009hours PICU stay, protein adequacy was significantly associated with greater PICU (adjusted \u03b2 coefficient, 6.35 [95% CI, 1.66-11.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.009) and MV days (adjusted \u03b2 coefficient, 5.22 [95% CI, 1.06-9.38]; P\u2009=\u2009.015).",
          "Among bronchiolitis patients admitted to the PICU, low WLZ at admission was associated with a longer duration of PICU stay and MV. Protein adequacy was associated with longer PICU and MV days in children with \u226548\u2009hours of PICU stay."

        "AbstractText": [
          "Juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) is a heterogeneous systemic immune-mediated vasculopathy. This study was undertaken to 1) identify inflammation/endothelial dysfunction-related biomarker profiles reflecting disease severity at diagnosis, and 2) establish whether such biomarker profiles could be used for predicting the response to treatment in patients with juvenile DM.",
          "In total, 39 biomarkers related to activation of endothelial cells, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation were measured using multiplex technology in serum samples from treatment-naive patients with juvenile DM from 2 independent cohorts (n = 30 and n = 29). Data were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering, nonparametric tests with correction for multiple comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier tests with Cox proportional hazards models for analysis of treatment duration. Myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) were measured in the patients' serum using line blot assays.",
          "Severe vasculopathy in patients with juvenile DM was associated with low serum levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Spearman's rho [r<sub>s</sub> ] = 0.465, P = 0.0111) and high serum levels of endoglin (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.67, P < 0.0001). In the discovery cohort, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the biomarker profiles yielded 2 distinct patient clusters, of which the smaller cluster (cluster 1; n = 8) exhibited high serum levels of CXCL13, CCL19, galectin-9, CXCL10, tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (TNFRII), and galectin-1 (false discovery rate <0.0001), and this cluster had greater severity of muscle disease and global disease activity (each P < 0.05 versus cluster 2). In the validation cohort, correlations between the serum levels of galectin-9, CXCL10, TNFRII, and galectin-1 and the severity of global disease activity were confirmed (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.40-0.52, P < 0.05). Stratification of patients according to the 4 confirmed biomarkers identified a cluster of patients with severe symptoms (comprising 64.7% of patients) who were considered at high risk of requiring more intensive treatment in the first 3 months after diagnosis (P = 0.0437 versus other cluster). Moreover, high serum levels of galectin-9, CXCL10, and TNFRII were predictive of a longer total treatment duration (P < 0.05). The biomarker-based clusters were not evidently correlated with patients' MSA serotypes.",
          "Results of this study confirm the heterogeneity of new-onset juvenile DM based on serum biomarker profiles. Patients with high serum levels of galectin-9, CXCL10, TNFRII, and galectin-1 may respond suboptimally to conventional treatment, and may therefore benefit from more intensive monitoring and/or treatment."

          "Air pollution, climate change, and reduced biodiversity are major threats to human health with detrimental effects on a variety of chronic noncommunicable diseases in particular respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The extent of air pollution both outdoor and indoor air pollution and climate change including global warming is increasing-to alarming proportions particularly in the developing world especially rapidly industrializing countries worldwide. In recent years, Asia has experienced rapid economic growth and a deteriorating environment and increase in allergic diseases to epidemic proportions. Air pollutant levels in many Asian countries especially in China and India are substantially higher than are those in developed countries. Moreover, industrial, traffic-related, and household biomass combustion, indoor pollutants from chemicals and tobacco are major sources of air pollutants, with increasing burden on respiratory allergies. Here we highlight the major components of outdoor and indoor air pollutants and their impacts on respiratory allergies associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis in the Asia-Pacific region. With Asia-Pacific comprising more than half of the world's population there is an urgent need to increase public awareness, highlight targets for interventions, public advocacy and a call to action to policy makers to implement policy changes towards reducing air pollution with interventions at a population-based level."

          "The prevalence of peanut allergy (PA) among children has increased significantly over the past decade. Even though the prevalence of PA in Singapore is considered low, peanut is the top trigger for food-induced anaphylaxis in Singaporean children.",
          "To describe the demographic characteristics and clinical features of children with PA.",
          "This is a 5-year retrospective review of children diagnosed with PA based on clinical history coupled with a positive skin prick test to peanut or positive oral food challenge results.",
          "There were 269 patients (53.9% males) with a clinical diagnosis of PA. The median age at first allergic presentation for the PA group was 24 months old, with interquartile range of 13-39 months. The most common form of peanut introduced was roasted peanut. The rate of peanut anaphylaxis was 7.1%. Concomitant tree nut sensitization was found in 32.3% of this cohort, predominantly to cashew nut. Majority of them have a personal history of atopy - 75.8% with eczema, 63.6% with allergic rhinitis, and 19.7% with asthma.",
          "This is the first large review of peanut-allergic children in Singapore. Prospective population-based studies are needed to establish the true prevalence and risk factors associated with the development of this potentially life-threatening condition."

          "These include the need for adjunct medications such as aminophylline or magnesium sulfate, the need for supplementary ventilation and the need for admission to the high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU).",
          "There were 285 patients included in the study, of whom 78 (27.4%) had PP at ED presentation. There were 40 (14.0%) who had PP after initial management. Children who had PP after initial management had significantly relative risks (RR) of requiring adjunct medications (RR 12.5, 95% CI 4.0 to 38.6), need for supplementary ventilation (RR 5.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 26.5) and admission to the HDU/ICU (RR 5.6, 95% CI 3.0 to 10.4).",
          "Qualitative detection of PP on pulse oximetry can be used as a potential point-of-care tool to help in the assessment of response to initial treatment in paediatric patients with acute moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. Future studies are needed to assess and validate its role in guiding ED management of acute paediatric asthma."

          "Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) is a major cause of neonatal death and long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities among survivors. The common pathogens causing EOS are group B <i>streptococcus</i> (GBS) and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (<i>H.</i><i>influenzae</i>) is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that can cause severe invasive disease and can be divided into either typeable or non-typeable strains. <i>H.</i><i>influenzae</i> serotype b (Hib) is the most virulent and the major cause of bacterial meningitis in young children prior to routine immunization against Hib. Hib infection rates have dramatically reduced since then. However, a number of studies have reported an increasing incidence of non-typeable <i>H. influenzae</i> (NTHi) sepsis in neonates worldwide and concluded that pregnant women may have an increased risk to invasive NTHi disease with poor pregnancy outcomes. We present a case of fulminant neonatal sepsis caused by NTHi in an extremely preterm infant and discuss potential preventative measures to reduce its re-emergence."

          "Introduction Dedifferentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (DEAC) was first described in 2007. However, it has only been recognised as a distinct subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the last 1-2\u00a0years. DEAC is a more aggressive histological subtype and carries a poorer prognosis. Patients with DEAC tend to present with advanced disease compared the other endometrioid adenocarcinomas. Methodology The study is a retrospective review of patients with DEAC diagnosed in two institutions in Singapore between January 2012 and October 2017. Results 7 patients were diagnosed with DEAC. The mean age was 56.4\u00a0years. All patients presented with either abnormal uterine bleeding or post menopausal bleeding. Out of the 7 patients, one was diagnosed with Stage 2 disease, 5 were diagnosed with Stage 3 disease and 1 was diagnosed with Stage 4 disease. One patient had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery, and completion chemotherapy post surgery. The other 6 patients (87.5%) underwent primary debulking surgery. Out of these 6 patients, 5 patients had adjuvant chemotherapy post surgery and one patient had both adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lymphovascular invasion was found in 71.4% of the cases. Conclusion DEAC is a more aggressive histological subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinomas. Better awareness of this condition can lead to proper diagnosis and treatment."

          "The effect of perioperative music listening has been proven to relieve preoperative anxiety and depression, while improving patient satisfaction. However, music listening has not been extensively studied in Singapore. Therefore, the primary aim of our study is to investigate the patient satisfaction towards perioperative music listening in the local setting. The secondary aim is to investigate the effect of perioperative music listening in reducing patient surgery-related anxiety and depression.",
          "After obtaining ethics board approval, we conducted a quasiexperimental study on a cohort of female patients who were undergoing elective minor gynaecological surgeries. Apple iPod Touch\u2122 devices containing playlists of selected music genres and noise-cancelling earphones were given to patients to listen during the preoperative and postoperative periods. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, music listening preferences, and patient satisfaction surveys were administered. Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar's tests for paired data were used for analysis.",
          "83 patients were analysed with 97.6% of patients in the preoperative period and 98.8% of patients in the postoperative period were satisfied with music listening. The median (IQR [range]) score for preintervention HADS anxiety was 7.0 (6.0 [0-17]), significantly higher than that in postintervention at 2.0 (4.0 [0-12]) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in preintervention HADS depression as compared to postintervention (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in preintervention HADS depression as compared to postintervention (.",

          "We aim to evaluate the diagnostic value and time course response of the triple inflammatory markers: white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil percentage (Neu), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in pediatric acute appendicitis.",
          "A retrospective review of clinical data pertaining to 1391 patients admitted with suspicion for pediatric appendicitis from 2012 to 2017 was conducted. Triple inflammatory markers were acquired upon admission. Appendicitis was confirmed histologically post-appendectomy. The diagnostic value and time course response of these markers was trended in relation to the duration of abdominal pain on admission.",
          "718 patients had histologically confirmed appendicitis. WBC and Neu demonstrate high sensitivity for early appendicitis at 94.6% and 80.0% at Day 1, while CRP demonstrates highest sensitivity of 97.9% at Day 4. The triple markers had poor overall diagnostic value when interpreted individually, however, had a high combined sensitivity of 99.7% and negative predictive value of 98.7% regardless of duration of disease. Overall negative appendectomy rate was 6.7% (n\u2009=\u200952). Among 19 patients with triple markers negative who underwent appendectomy, 17 (89.5%) were histologically normal.",
          "The triple inflammatory markers have limited diagnostic value when interpreted individually, but are strong discriminators of pediatric appendicitis when combined. Their high sensitivity and negative predictive value could potentially help patients avoid unnecessary admissions or costly imaging studies, and reduce negative appendectomy rates. In addition, their objective nature confers an advantage over existing clinical scoring systems which comprise subjective elements."

          "<i>Background</i>. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Pediatric patients are more likely to develop severe disease. Abdominal TB is a rare manifestation of pediatric TB and can present with chronic and nonspecific abdominal symptoms. This study examines the clinical profile of pediatric patients with abdominal TB and treatment outcomes. <i>Method</i>. A retrospective study of patients admitted to a tertiary pediatric hospital in Singapore over 10 years. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were examined. <i>Results.</i> There were 3 male and 3 female patients with mean age of 11.3 years. Household contacts were traced in 3 cases. The most common presenting symptoms were fever, weight loss, and abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Inflammatory markers were raised with mean C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) rate at 70.9 mg/L and 90 mm/h respectively. Abdominal imaging showed abnormalities such as splenic foci and thickened bowel wall with significant intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> was isolated from stool, rectal swabs and intra-adominal specimens. Two patients underwent excisional biopsy of lymph node to obtain diagnosis. Two patients required emergency laparotomy and 1 patient received esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Four out of the 6 patients had pulmonary involvement. <i>Conclusion</i>. Abdominal TB should be a differential diagnosis in children with chronic abdominal symptoms for at least 8 weeks with anemia, raised ESR and CRP. The gold standard for diagnosis still remains as positive microbiological culture. However, abdominal imaging studies are also vital in obtaining further supportive evidence for chronic infection."

          "Prosthetic pulmonary valves are widely used in the management procedures of various congenital heart diseases, including the surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (RVOT). The discouraging long-term outcomes of standard prostheses, including homografts and bioprosthetic, constrained their indications. Recent developments in the expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) pulmonary prosthetic valves provide promising alternatives. In this study, the hemodynamic characteristics of bileaflet and trileaflet ePTFE valve designs were experimentally evaluated. The <i>in vitro</i> tests were performed under the right ventricle (RV) flow conditions by using an <i>in vitro</i> RV circulatory system and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The leaflet kinetics, trans-valvular pressure gradients, effective orifice areas, regurgitant fractions, energy losses, velocity fields, and Reynolds shear stress (RSS) in both prostheses were evaluated. The opening of the bileaflet and trileaflet valve takes 0.060 and 0.088 s, respectively. The closing of the former takes 0.140 s, in contrast to 0.176 s of the latter. The trans-valvular pressure is 6.8 mmHg in the bileaflet valve vs. 7.9 mmHg in the trileaflet valve. The effective orifice area is 1.83 cm<sup>2</sup> in the bileaflet valve and 1.72 cm<sup>2</sup> in the trileaflet valve. The regurgitant fraction and energy loss of bileaflet are 7.13% and 82 mJ, which are 7.84% and 101.64 mJ in its bileaflet counterpart. The maximum RSS of 48.0 and 49.2 Pa occur at the systole peak in the bileaflet and trileaflet valve, respectively. A higher average RSS level is found in the bileaflet valve. The results from this preliminary study indicate that the current bileaflet prosthetic valve design is capable of providing a better overall hemodynamic performance than the trileaflet design."

          "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disorder of pregnancy that is increasingly prevalent among Chinese women. Few studies have examined whether the migration status of Chinese women contributes to the risks of developing GDM during pregnancy.",
          "In this observational, cross-sectional and hospital-based study, we examined the prevalence of GDM and glycemic levels at oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) among 491 Australian Chinese migrants (n=491) and native Chinese (n=1000). We defined GDM using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups guidelines. We collected data on maternal age, body mass index (BMI) and gestational age (GA) at booking and GA at delivery from medical records. We used multiple logistic and linear regression models to calculate the OR of having GDM and mean differences in glycemic levels in Australian Chinese migrants, relative to native Chinese.",
          "Age-at-booking and BMI-at-booking adjusted GDM prevalence was significantly higher in Australian Chinese migrants than native Chinese (19.7% vs 14.6%; p=0.01). After adjusting for age, BMI at booking and GA at booking, fasting glucose levels were significantly lower (\u03b2 -0.08\u2009mmol/L; 95%\u2009CI -0.14 to 0.02), while 2-hour glucose levels were significantly higher (0.22\u2009mmol/L; 0.02 to 0.43) in Australian Chinese immigrants than native Chinese.",
          "Migration status may be a marker for abnormal glucose metabolism during pregnancy among Australian Chinese migrants, possibly due to socio-economic disadvantages and lifestyle changes associated with migration."

          "Paediatric meningiomas are extremely rare. These tumours constitute only 2 to 3% of all childhood brain tumours. Despite similarities in histological features between PMs and their adult counterparts, there are important distinctions between them. In this case series, the authors describe their experience in paediatric meningiomas in Singapore's 2 children's hospitals from 1998 to 2018. The primary aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical, radiological and pathological characteristics, and associated outcomes of paediatric patients diagnosed with meningioma managed in our local institutions. Following that, the study's findings are secondary aims are corroborated with published literature. A total of 10 patients (4 males and 6 females) were identified for this study within the period of 01 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. Their ages ranged from 1\u00a0year old to 18\u00a0years old (median age 10.5\u00a0years old). Two of the patients had NF1 and NF2 respectively. There were 9 intracranial and 1 intraspinal paediatric meningiomas. Seven patients achieved gross total resection and 3 patients had subtotal resection. Eight patients did not have tumour recurrence or increase in size of tumour remnant during the course of their follow-up. In congruency with the literature, up to 40% of our patients had higher grade meningiomas and 55.6% had large tumour volumes more than 30\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>. Owing to the paucity of knowledge for this unusual tumour, the authors emphasize the need for closer surveillance and in-depth genomic studies to identify novel therapies for this challenging condition."

          "<b>Background:</b> Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with pruritus and sleep loss. Pine-tar has long been used for various chronic skin conditions in which its polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) component is anti-inflammatory and its resin acids antiseptic. The null hypothesis of this trial is that there is no difference in clinical efficacy between a pine-tar product and its vehicle for AD.<b>Methods:</b> A 3-month, investigator-blinded, crossover, randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted in which each patient was assigned to bathing with pine-tar bath oil for one month and vehicle bath oil for another, with a washout period of 1-month in-between. Acceptability and efficacy of the bath products were measured. Disease severity scores (scoring atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) and patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM), quality of life questionnaires, noninvasive skin biophysiological measurements, blood IgE levels, and S<i>taphylococcus aureus</i> (SA) colonization status were assessed before and following bathing.<b>Results:</b> Significant improvements were found in total SCORAD (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.030), POEM (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.004), SA colonization status (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.002), and log-transformed IgE level (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.009) among patients who bathed with pine-tar in the overall RCT study using intention-to-treat analysis. For per protocol analysis, significant improvements were found in total SCORAD (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.024), objective SCORAD (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.011), extent (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.014), intensity (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.032), pruritus (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.047), POEM (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.044), SA colonization status (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.035), and log-transformed IgE level (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.028). Acceptability to both bath-oils was good, and no product-related serious adverse events were recorded.<b>Conclusions:</b> Bathing with pine-tar is an efficacious and recommendable adjuvant practice for AD patients. Disease improvement is associated with reduction of SA and IgE."

          "Microsurgery is a surgical technique that uses optical magnification as well as specific instruments to address necessary reconstructive procedures in different medical specialties. The apprenticeship of this technique requires overcoming a steep learning curve. There is a need for standardization of the training criteria in microsurgery. The International Microsurgery Simulation Society (IMSS) was born in 2011, since then its main objective has been to connect the main international specialists and educators of this sub-specialty to share and discuss the ethical and scientific basis of preclinical microsurgery teaching.",
          "In order to achieve a consensus on the minimum standards for the organization of basic microsurgery training courses, the requirements for a microsurgical anastomosis global rating scale and minimum thresholds for training, a total of nineteen independent global experts participated in a formal consultative consensus development program. The agreement criteria for each statement was established when consensus of 65-100% was reached.",
          "There have been established six recommendations concerning minimum standards for a basic microsurgery course, one recommendation in relation to minimum thresholds for training and four recommendations regarding the global rating scale as gold standard for a microsurgical anastomosis assessment. The eleven defined recommendations reached the agreement threshold of 65-100%.",
          "The development of this consensus sets the minimum recommended requirements for conducting basic microsurgery training courses, as well as suggestions for objective assessment of the learning curve and skills of trainees."

      "Abstract": {
        "AbstractText": [
          "Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue used for treating congenital chylothorax and congenital hyperinsulinism in infants. By increasing splanchnic arteriolar resistance and decreasing gastrointestinal blood flow, octreotide indirectly reduces lymphatic flow in chylous effusions.Splanchnic ischaemia following octreotide predisposes infants to necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Although NEC occurrence in infants treated with octreotide for hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia has been reported widely, its incidence in infants with chylothroax is low. We describe a case of congenital chylothorax in a preterm infant who had poor response to thoracentesis. Although octreotide initiation lead to resolution of chylothorax, he developed NEC. Cessation of octreotide and medical management resulted in rapid resolution of NEC. Since octreotide is generally used as the first-line treatment for chylous effusion, the risk of NEC should be considered, especially when the dosage is increased. Infants on octreotide should be closely observed for early signs and symptoms of NEC to avert surgical emergency."
